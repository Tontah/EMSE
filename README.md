This project is an experimental project to see if code indentation helps with better code understanding.
The user running the code gets a series of codes( mathematical questions) printed to them which they are supposed to calculate and enter their answer in the console.
The programm prints codes with indentation and without indentation.
The programm also calculates the question and stores rhe answer along side with the time the user used to calculate the answer and the answer the user entered .
These information will be later used in a different software for statistical analysis.
